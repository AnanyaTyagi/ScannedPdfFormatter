<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of reducing impervious surface</p>
<p>coverage by using compact development. Compact development can be used to meet the</p>
<p>pollution reduction requirements of the Clean Water Act as implemented through the</p>
<p>National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) storm water discharge</p>
<p>permitting process. Various court cases and laws have been cited to give background to</p>
<p>development of the NPDES permit. Information has been garnered through the Internet</p>
<p>and published resources.</p>
<p>Insights to the NPDES storm water permitting process were gathered by attending</p>
<p>meetings of the State of California Regional Water Quality Control Board for Region II</p>
<p>(the San Francisco Bay area) on December 18, 2002, January 22, 2003 and February 19,</p>
<ul>
<li>2003. Public hearings were held at these meetings regarding the inclusion of the</li>
</ul>
<p>treatment of runoff from new development and redevelopment in the Phase 1 NPDES</p>
<p>storm water discharge permits for Contra Costa County, Alameda County, and San Mateo</p>
<p>County. Four supplemental stakeholder meetings were are also attended where</p>
<p>discussions were held on new development and redevelopment storm water treatment</p>
<p>permit requirements that were being considered by the Regional Board. These meetings</p>
<p>were scheduled in response to the extensive public testimony at the December 18 hearing.</p>
<p>A one-day workshop entitled"Storm Water Pollution Prevention Sustainable Strategies</p>
<p>Workshop" sponsored by Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAC) was also</p>
<p>attended on January 30, 2003.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Urban storm water runoff has been recognized as a major contributor to water pollution.</p>
<p>Impervious surfaces created in conventional development through the addition of paved streets,</p>
<p>sidewalks, roofs, conventional storm water sewers and parking lots disrupt the natural hydrology</p>
<p>of an area. Impervious surface coverage disrupts the natural hydrology by increasing the</p>
<p>discharge rates and volumes of storm water runoff, eroding and incising waterways, adding</p>
<p>pollutants to the waterways, increasing flooding potential, and diminishing the recharge of</p>
<p>aquifers from rainfall (Largo 2001, 75).</p>
<p>The federal government has also recognized this immense problem. The US Environmental</p>
<p>Protection Agency issued Storm Water Phase 1 (1990) and Phase 2 (1999) Final Rules under the</p>
<p>Clean Water Act (1972) for all urbanized areas across the country to develop Storm Water</p>
<p>Management Programs under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)</p>
<p>using Best Management Practices (BMPs). The California State Water Resources Control Board</p>
<p>administers this rule in California as authorized by the Porter Cologne Water Quality Act (2002).</p>
<p>All communities across the country are required to develop best management practices for</p>
<p>removing pollutants from storm water runoff to the maximum extent practicable. The most</p>
<p>commonly used BMPs are storm water detention basins. However, these basins prolong peak</p>
<p>flows during storm events causing more erosion of waterways.</p>
<p>Communities are beginning to recognize that the design of the community can help alleviate</p>
<p>these problems. The Metro, the regional governing agency of the Portland, Oregon area, has</p>
<p>recognized this potential and is implementing its “Green Streets” program to help alleviate the</p>
<p>runoff from impervious surfaces. The Metro’s “Green Streets” program implemented a highly</p>
<p>connected multimodal transportation system that preserves or restores streams and wild life</p>
<p>corridors (Metro June 2002,1).</p>
<p>The States of Maryland, Florida and more recently Wisconsin, Michigan and New Jersey are</p>
<p>also taking the lead in implementing statewide goals and principles in protecting their watersheds</p>

<p>from urban runoff with strong governor support and initiative. These states and other areas of</p>
<p>the country are also recognizing the importance of reducing impervious surfaces in protecting the</p>
<p>nation’s waterways.</p>
<p>The combination of environmental protection and urban design is a recognized method for</p>
<p>achieving the goals set forth in the Storm Water Phase 1 and 2 Rules. Environmentally aware</p>
<p>urban design also establishes a sense of place for residents of communities and allows for a</p>
<p>greater potential for citizen participation in environmental restoration projects and maintenance</p>
<p>of these projects. The question is then posed: can the NPDES Storm Water Final Rules promote</p>
<p>the reduction of impervious surfaces through urban design?</p>
<p>The decision to use urban design to mitigate storm water runoff needs to be made by local</p>
<p>elected officials, builders, planning departments, public works, fire departments and residents.</p>
<p>Maintaining the natural habitat and the region’s hydrology during development is the primary</p>
<p>role of site design in treating runoff This design works best with cluster style development of</p>
<p>homes and businesses. The idea of cluster design shares ideals with the Neo-traditional and New</p>
<p>Urbanist concepts of compact development.</p>
<p>Elected officials and community residents can embrace compact /cluster developments by</p>
<p>incorporating it into their general plan. In California, the Cities of Salinas and Marina have done</p>
<p>this. General plans could also specify that storm water systems must encourage percolation to</p>
<p>recharge aquifers locally. This was done in the Marina General Plan. Compact development will</p>
<p>reduce the amount of infrastructure needed for development, hence saving the City and the</p>
<p>developer construction and maintenance costs. Adopting more open styles of storm water</p>
<p>conveyance and treatment, such as the use of swales instead of curb and gutter, will also save</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>development and maintenance costs. This style of development was used very successfully at</p>
<p>Village Homes in Davis, California.</p>
<p>Ifthe public desires compact development, then zoning and building ordinances must be</p>
<p>rewritten to encourage it. Strict single use zoning codes favor conventional building styles and</p>
<p>methods, making it difficult for different building styles to be used. Determined builders have</p>
<p>2</p>
</section>
<hr/>
<section data-page='9'><h3>Page 9</h3>
<p>used planned development agreements, which would allow them the freedom to design compact</p>
<p>styles of developments such as cluster development and New Urbanist communities. Compact</p>
<p>design has been used in communities such as Village Homes; Reston, Virginia; Prairie Crossing,</p>
<p>Illinois; and Columbia, Maryland. Planned Development Agreements (PDAs), which are</p>
<p>development agreements between a municipality and the developer normally resulting in density</p>
<p>bonuses for the planned development, are not by-right developments. By-right development</p>
<p>allows development that meets the zoning standards for a parcel or parcels, i.e. medium density</p>
<p>residential at 5 units per acre. Changing the zoning to increase the density requires a public</p>
<p>hearing, which can be expensive, time consuming and often is denied. In order for</p>
<p>environmentally sensitive, cluster style development to become the norm as opposed to</p>
<p>conventional style development, the demand for compact/cluster development needs to be</p>
<p>created by elected officials, financial institutions, planners, builders, public works departments</p>
<p>and residents.</p>
<p>Civil engineers and public works departments also need to realize the advantages of cluster</p>
<p>development that limits the creation of impervious surfaces through narrowing streets and using</p>
<p>storm water systems other than conventional Municipal Separate Storm Water Sewer Systems</p>
<p>(MS4s). “Green Streets” programs favor narrow streets and landscaped areas through which to</p>
<p>convey storm water runoff. In “Green Streets” programs vegetated swales are used in place of</p>
<p>conventional underground storm drains. These green areas can be used for multiple uses such as</p>
<p>runoff conveyance, percolation, nutrient uptake, habitat, bicycle trails and footpaths. However,</p>
<p>winning over the bureaucrats in the public works and public safety departments to favor</p>
<p>alternatives other then wide streets with curb and gutter has been a challenge.</p>
<p>It can be argued that developing the same number of units on less land is a win-win situation for</p>
<p>both the community and the builder. The infrastructure costs would be reduced, significantly</p>
<p>lowering the overhead for the builder and additionally their profit margin for the smaller lots is</p>
<p>increased, while also satisfying the pollution reduction clause in the Storm Water Management</p>
<p>Program required by the Clean Water Act.</p>

<p>PROBLEM DEFINITION</p>
<p>Understanding the potential implication of the NPDES Storm Water Final Rules in promoting</p>
<p>the reduction of impervious surfaces through urban design requires the understanding storm</p>
<p>water runoff and its relationships to the hydrologic cycle and the environment.</p>
<p>Storm Water Runoff</p>
<p>To understand the effects of impervious surface on the environment, the hydrologic cycle must</p>
<p>be understood. In urbanized communities the natural ground cover of roots, leaf litter, forests or</p>
<p>grasslands are replaced with impervious surfaces such as roadways, curbs and gutters, sidewalks,</p>
<p>roofs, parking lots and other hardened or compacted surfaces. Where once natural ground cover</p>
<p>allowed rainfall to slowly percolate and infiltrate into aquifers, streams and lakes; rainfall</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>runs off the roadways, sidewalks, rooftops and other compacted surfaces disrupting the natural</p>
<p>hydrological cycle. Evapo-transpiration and underground interflow between the soil and bedrock,</p>
<p>and base flow within an aquifer are greatly reduced with impervious surfaces (Fig. 1).</p>
<p>Impervious surfaces are the hardened surfaces of urbanized communities that prevent natural</p>
<p>infiltration into the soil during rainfall events. Rainfall is not absorbed through the hardened</p>
<p>surfaces, therefore impeding the removal of pollutants from runoff. Percolation</p>
<p>removes</p>
<p>pollutants in the top six inches of soil (BASMAA 1999, 37). The runoff from these hardened</p>
<p>surfaces contains a multitude of pollutants and sediments compared to predevelopment runoff.</p>
